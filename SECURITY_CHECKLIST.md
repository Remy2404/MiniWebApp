# Security Checklist - Telegram Mini Web App

## ✅ Completed Security Improvements

### 🔒 Removed Hardcoded Secrets
- ✅ Removed ngrok URL from `vite.config.ts`
- ✅ Removed hardcoded backend URLs from source code
- ✅ Moved all sensitive URLs to environment variables
- ✅ Created `.env.example` template without sensitive data

### 🛡️ Environment Security
- ✅ Added `VITE_BACKEND_URL` environment variable
- ✅ Made production URLs configurable via environment
- ✅ Added fallbacks for development mode
- ✅ Environment files already in `.gitignore`

### 📝 Logging Security
- ✅ Conditional logging (only in development)
- ✅ No sensitive URLs logged in production
- ✅ Removed console logs in production builds (terser config)
- ✅ Secure error handling without exposing internals

### 🌐 Network Security
- ✅ CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- ✅ Secure headers in API requests
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement for production
- ✅ Request timeout configuration

### 🔧 Build Security
- ✅ Production build removes console logs
- ✅ Terser minification for production
- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ Secure proxy configuration

## 🚀 Deployment Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Set `VITE_BACKEND_URL` in deployment environment
- [ ] Verify backend URL uses HTTPS
- [ ] Test API connectivity in staging
- [ ] Confirm environment variables are not in source code
- [ ] Check that `.env` files are not committed

### After Deployment
- [ ] Test all API endpoints
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data in browser console
- [ ] Check network tab for secure connections
- [ ] Confirm authentication flow works
- [ ] Monitor for any exposed URLs in logs

## 🔄 Maintenance Security

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Rotate backend URLs periodically (if using temporary URLs like ngrok)
- [ ] Update environment variables when backend changes
- [ ] Monitor for any hardcoded values creeping back in
- [ ] Review and update CORS policies
- [ ] Check for dependency vulnerabilities

### When Backend Changes
- [ ] Update `VITE_BACKEND_URL` environment variable
- [ ] Test connectivity from frontend
- [ ] Update any documentation
- [ ] Verify authentication still works
- [ ] Check CORS configuration on new backend

## 🚨 Security Warnings

### Never Do This
- ❌ Don't commit `.env` files with real URLs
- ❌ Don't hardcode URLs in source code
- ❌ Don't expose sensitive data in console logs
- ❌ Don't use HTTP for production backends
- ❌ Don't share ngrok URLs publicly

### Red Flags to Watch For
- 🚩 URLs visible in source code
- 🚩 Sensitive data in browser console
- 🚩 Mixed content warnings (HTTP/HTTPS)
- 🚩 CORS errors in production
- 🚩 Environment variables in git history

## 📋 Emergency Response

### If URLs are Exposed
1. Immediately rotate/change the backend URL
2. Update environment variables
3. Redeploy frontend and backend
4. Check git history for exposed data
5. Consider if any tokens need rotation

### If Authentication is Compromised
1. Check Telegram bot token security
2. Verify WebApp authentication flow
3. Review server logs for unusual activity
4. Update authentication validation logic if needed
